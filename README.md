# MPGify
Web-page that trains a model in browser using Tensorflow.js

Given "Horsepower" for a car, this model will learn to predict "Miles per Gallon" (MPG).

Methodology:
- Load the data and prepare it for training.
- Define the architecture of the model.
- Train the model and monitor its performance as it trains.
- Evaluate the trained model by making some predictions.

To run this project.
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to `index.html` and render in your browser
3. To tweak the model. navigate to `script.js`
4. Try changing the `epoch` number or adden more hidden layers to the neural network
